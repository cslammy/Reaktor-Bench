# Reaktor-Bench
Tools used on my bench--reaktor 5 ensembles and instruments 

Requires a DC coupled I/O module such as expert sleepers ES3, ES6, and/or ES8.

Might be useful for anyone else who owns Reaktor 5 or 6 and uses it to generate test signals as part of their workflow.

Otherwise, probably of no use to you.
